# Cheapamp

The Cheapamp amplifier is a compact general-purpose --- though audio-oriented --- class-D power amplifier with analog volume controls and a pin-header for full digital control. It is based on the MAX9736A/B monolithic amplifier.

The board design is heavily centered around the filter-less recommended design shown in the datasheet, and is configurable for either mono (bridged) or stereo applications.
