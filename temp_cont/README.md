# Temperature Controller

Temperature Controller  is a general-purpose temperature controller that can be used for any single-ended load such as a resistive heater, cooling fan, refrigerator/freezer, either directly or through some intermediary (such as a relay).

The control law can be varied from a linear ramp in power between two levels to a purely hysteric output, with an additional minimum duty cycle and minimum switch period. Complementary OK and ERROR outputs indicate a temperature-out-of-range and/or temperature-sensor error condition. A rotary encoder and three-digit seven-segment display is used to configure parameters and display the current temperature.
